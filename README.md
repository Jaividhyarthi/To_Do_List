# ✅ To-Do App – Task Manager

Welcome to the **To-Do App**, a simple and efficient task management tool built as part of **Task 2** for the Web Development Internship.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **To-Do App** allows users to manage their daily tasks with ease. You can add, complete, and delete tasks — and most importantly, your tasks will stay saved even after refreshing the browser, thanks to **Local Storage**.

This project highlights fundamental JavaScript skills like DOM manipulation, event handling, and persistence using Web Storage APIs.
